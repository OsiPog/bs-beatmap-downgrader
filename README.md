# Beat Saber Beatmap Downgrader

A cli tool to downgrade any Beat Saber beatmap written in difficulty file V3 to V2    

Thanks to the Beat Saber Modding Group for having the file formats wonderfully documented: https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/map-format.html

## Usage

You can use the `downgrader.py` script on a single beatmap folder and it will create a downgraded version of that beatmap next to it.

```
python downgrader.py C:\absolute\path\to\beatmap
```
